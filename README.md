# Fullstack Bank Website

I have created a Bank website using backend [MongoDB / Mongoose ] and frontend [React].

## Links

- Backend : https://bank-api-backend-using-mongoose.onrender.com/
- Frontend : https://bank-mongoose-frontend.netlify.app/

## About

I have used axios package to connect my backend with my frontend.
The first page shows all the clients in the bank with all of their details ,
ID , Name , Email , Cash , Credit , Activision Status.
You will also find a more info button next to each user info , when u click on it it will take you
to the client's page where you will be able to Deposit Cash , Withdraw Money , Update Credit and Transfer Money,
you can transfer money only to active clients.
